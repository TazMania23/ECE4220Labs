Common Buffer
->GPS data from N_pipe1 P1
->Time_GPS P1 250ms
->Time from Button pressed P2
->GPS Data/Location (we must calculate that, its unknown)P2

Week 1 (Part1&Part2)
Get libraries and etc from Lab 3
Main must open its side of the pipe before you can recieve any data
-just get them talking- print the talk as check
-Time stamp before and after GPS 0-255. A time at what you recieved the data- print to 
-struct buffer or a global buffer- buffer accepts GPS values and time stamp corrosponding
-pthread0 has access to the buffer and print from the thread- print from thread is check
-gps writes only until the pipe opens up 
Week 2
-checks every 75ms lab 2
-check button lab 3 
-when the button is pressed, it will send the timestamp to pthread 0
-dynamic threads -_- 
-two seperate programs for the different processes 
3 terminals

sudo insmod ece4220lab3.ko
lab3.ko checks for the change from low to high (1 and 2)
sudo rmmod ece4220lab3
lab4.ko checks for a constant hold, high then hold (3 & 4)

To make GPS_Device executable (to give it permission) chmod +x GPS_device
To remove executable permission chmod -x Lab4*.c
gcc -g Lab4_Main.c -o Lab4_Main -lpthread -lwiringPi  libece4220lab3.a
gcc -g Lab4_Process2.c -o Lab4_Process2 -lpthread -lwiringPi  libece4220lab3.a
gcc -g Lab4_Button
lab 2 end of slides gettimeofday()

Delete Pipe sudo rm pipename
