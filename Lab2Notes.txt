Part 1
1) Load data from text file
2) Get current time
3)Create Threads
4)Join Threads
5)Get stop time
6)Count, examine time
7)Average

reading in mili seconds
./Lab2_Week2 2x100.txt 5
matrix file number you were looking fo 



loop around 2-6



Part 2
3 threads In main
T1-read in 1 line of text file and store it into Common Buffer 1 3
T2-read in 1 line of text 2 file and store it into common buffer 2 4
T3- Runs and grabs what in common buffer and stores it into StringArray[20]

T1 T3 T2 T3 T1 T2 T3

1)Elevate priority >50
2)Create Timer
3)Structure -> start time ->period
4)Start Timer set seconds to 0 and ns to 0
5)Wait one period before running the threads
6)do what thread was intended to do
Goal: how quick can this run 
need to use join
sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_FIFO, &param);-> 0 implies whatever thread the method is used in

itval.it_value.tv_nsec = InitTime_nseconds; ->  set this to 100 to avoid errors

T1 & T2 same period
T3 is half the period as T1 or T2
