Notes
For lab Report (other ways to test for stuff)

Only one light can be on at a time
Green-Light1 Yellow-Light2 Red-ped                                                                                                                                     

1st way is Polled Scheduling
-set up a queue and go in order loop and see if tasks needs to be done
-check_button to see if ped is there. 1 if person is there 0 if no one is there
-after time frame call clear button which will set it to 0;
sudo insmod ece4220lab3.ko
sudo ./Lab3_Week1


2nd way Priority Scheduling 
-threads get different priorities 
-three threads and set priority above kernel and the threads have different proirities
Posix semaphore (this word sounds weird) www.csc.villanova.edu/-madmin/threads/posixem.html
1) elevate priority/ act real time
2) Set times, protect led, infinity loop!!! each thread
3) control led
4) Release Protection LED
5) small sleep
try without then try with
priotities in command line argument
play with both policys
sudo ./Lab3_Week2 Prior1 Policy1 Prior2 Policy2 Prior3 Policy3
Priorities bw 1 and 99
Policy->FIFO=1 RoundRobin(RR)=2

to run
sudo insmod ece4220lab3.ko
sudo ./Lab3_Week1


Both
set up gpio properly wiring pi
Left most pushbutton for cross walk
